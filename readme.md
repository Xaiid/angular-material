AngularJS directives for materialize css: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize

I wanted to use material design in a new Angular project but didn't find too many existing 
Angular directives with the features I needed.

* Existing solutions
- https://material.angularjs.org is the reference angular material implementation but I found its
mobile performance to be lacking.
- https://github.com/kresCruz/angular-materialize is a good start but not fully developed

Sooo I decided to create my own and in the process maybe it'll help others.

# Demo
